Built a fluid simulation in [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). Based on [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf), a legendary paper by Jos Stam, this was a very fun, pretty tricky project to tackle. Everything is done on the CPU, but I'd definitly like to migrate it to the GPU when I learn how. Viscocity, diffusion rate, colors, and a bunch of other options are configurable making it pretty fun to play with. Very fun project, albiet pretty math heavy. Highly reccomend giving it a go.
